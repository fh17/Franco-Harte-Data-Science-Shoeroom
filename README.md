#Franco Harte Portfolio

[Project 1: BMW agency's Price Predictor](https://github.com/fh17/Franco_portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio/Proyect_Prediction_BMW%20.ipynb)

Showcase of data engineering techniques and predictions.
Exploratory data analysis.
Data Cleaning and Preprossesing
Prediction method application
    Linear Regression 
    Support Vector Regression 
    K Neighbors Regressor 
    Decision Tree 
    Gradient Boosting Regressor
Evaluation of the models through different metrics and plots.

[Project 2: Malware detection](https://github.com/fh17/Franco_portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio/0322_SupML_Franco_Harte.ipynb)

This project is a Kaggle competition of Microsoft of 2016 where the goal was to make a model which predicts if a computurer was going to be infected.
Concepts that were emphasized inthis work were:
    Data cleaninig
    Optimisation of the code
    Metrics for evaluation

[Project 3: TimeSerie Benchmark](https://github.com/fh17/Franco_portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio/benchmark-ts-n-xgboost-kaggle.ipynb)

In this project I had to use the XGBoost algorithm to work with Time Series and the focus was on the "Benchmark " mode. To get a quick first resolt as the minimum score possible for the prediction 

[Proyect 4: Image Clasificator](https://github.com/fh17/Franco_portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio/DeepLearningProyect_ImagesClasificator.ipynb)

In the following project two approches were used, working with the dataset cifrar100 from Pytorch library. In the frist approch, the strategy was to use a pre-trained neuronal network called ResNet50 where classified the photos were classified into 100 different classes. In the second one, the strategy was to test different arquitectures looking for the highest accuracy.

[Project 5: Cliff Walking Problem](https://github.com/fh17/Franco_portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio/Cliff_Walking.ipynb)

The Walking Cliff project is a reinforcement learning problem from "gym library" where an agent, represented by a simple stick figure, must learn to navigate a cliff-like environment without falling. The agent receives rewards for reaching the end of the cliff and penalties for falling off. The project is designed to showcase the capabilities of reinforcement learning algorithms, which enable agents to learn from trial and error using a system of rewards and punishments.

[Problem 5: Final Proyect of the Master "DSMarket Data Science Implementation] (https://github.com/fh17/Franco_portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio/Copia%20de%20Franki%20TFM.ipynb)

This is the Final Evaluation of the Nuclio Digital School Data ScienceÂ´s Master. In which the student (myself) had to develop de hole deparment of  data science for the company SDMarket, Starting from analising and exploring all the sales data that the company was saving the last years, understandig the buisness, propousing ideas to improve the working sistem of the company, such as stock management, shipment work and publisity aplication. And also the debelopment of a maching lerning tool that can make all of this easier to do, and its subsequent implementation
